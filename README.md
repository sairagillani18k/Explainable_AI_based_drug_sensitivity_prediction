## Explainable AI based drug sensitivity prediction



 Built an explainable AI based drug sensitivity predictable model on cancer cell lines in order to translate critical information,
 produced during prediction, so that personalized medicine can be further improved, and medical practitioners can use that 
 translatable information more effectively. It will help medical practitioners decide which features have positive correlation 
 with drug response.
